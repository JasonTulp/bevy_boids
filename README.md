This project is a simple implementation of the boids flocking algorithm in Rust using Bevy.

## Running the project
To run the project, you need to have Rust installed. You can install it from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Simply clone the repo and run the following command in the root directory of the project:
```bash
cargo run
```

## Controls
- `W` - Move the player up
- `A` - Move the player left
- `S` - Move the player down
- `D` - Move the player right

Some flocking parameters can be adjusted using the in-game UI

## Screenshots
TBD


## TODO
- [ ] Experiment with spatial hash map optimisations
- [ ] Procedural chunk generation with free movement
